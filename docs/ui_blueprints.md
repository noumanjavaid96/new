# UI Blueprints (XML-like Structure)

This section refers to the XML-like structural blueprints that were generated to describe the layout and key elements of the main screens for the ContentFlow MVP.

These blueprints were provided as structured text output during our discussion and are intended to serve as a guide for UI developers and designers, complementing the narrative UI Screen Descriptions.

**Purpose:**
To offer a hierarchical, textual representation of screen elements, their types (e.g., `Button`, `TextInput`, `List`), and their intended actions or content.

**Content Provided:**
The XML-like structured text covered the following key screen groups:
*   Shared Screens (Authentication: Launch, Signup, Login)
*   Brand User UI Screens (Dashboard, Campaign Creation, View Submissions)
*   Clipper User UI Screens (Dashboard/Browse Campaigns, Campaign Details, My Work/Earnings, Submit Content)

**How to Use:**
This structural information should be used in conjunction with the detailed "Mobile UI Screen Descriptions" and the overall "User Flows" to inform the actual UI development in Next.js/React using ShadCN UI components.

> **Note:** The actual XML-like content blocks were provided in previous messages. You may choose to consolidate them here, link to separate files containing them, or use them as a direct reference for development.
