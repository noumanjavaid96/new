# Welcome to the ContentFlow Project Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the ContentFlow project, covering its vision, architecture, user flows, UI descriptions, and development plans, with a focus on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

ContentFlow aims to be a mobile-first marketplace connecting brands with talented content "clippers" (editors & distributors), revolutionizing how short-form video content is created, distributed, and rewarded.

**Navigate through the sections using the sidebar to learn more about:**

* **Project Overview & Definition:** Vision, goals, target audience, MVP features, and development roadmap.
* **System Architecture:** Technical design, components, data flows, and deployment strategy.
* **User Experience & Design:** Detailed user flows and UI screen descriptions.
* **UI Blueprints & Diagrams:** Structural layouts and system diagrams.

This documentation reflects the project's alignment with the Payper application model and its development as a Next.js Progressive Web App (PWA) for the initial 3-week MVP.
