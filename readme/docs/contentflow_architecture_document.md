# ContentFlow - Architecture Document (MVP v0.1)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose of this Document
This document outlines the proposed software architecture for the ContentFlow Minimum Viable Product (MVP). It describes the major components, their interactions, data flows, technology choices, and deployment strategies. The primary audience for this document includes the development team, project stakeholders, and any future architects or developers joining the project.

### 1.2. Project Overview (Brief summary from Project Documentation)
ContentFlow aims to be a mobile-first marketplace connecting brands with content "clippers" (editors/distributors). It will facilitate the creation, distribution, and performance-based rewarding of short-form video content. The MVP focuses on validating the core loop: Brand posts project -> Clipper edits/distributes -> Views are tracked -> Clipper gets paid.

### 1.3. Scope
This architectural design is specifically for the MVP of ContentFlow. It prioritizes rapid development, core functionality, and essential quality attributes like security and basic reliability. Scalability and advanced features will be iteratively built upon this foundational MVP architecture.

## 2. Architectural Goals & Constraints

### 2.1. Key Architectural Goals (Quality Attributes)

The architecture aims to achieve a balance of the following quality attributes for the MVP:

#### 2.1.1. Reliability
> **Goal:** The system must reliably perform its core functions, including campaign posting, content submission, (MVP-level) view tracking, and calculation of payouts. Data integrity is crucial.

#### 2.1.2. Scalability (for future growth)
> **Goal:** While the MVP will handle a limited load, the architecture should be designed with future user growth in mind. This means choosing technologies and patterns that allow for horizontal scaling of stateless components and managed scaling of stateful components where possible.

#### 2.1.3. Security
> **Goal:** Protecting user data (personal information, content, payment details) is paramount. The architecture must incorporate security best practices from the outset.

#### 2.1.4. Performance (especially for core user flows)
> **Goal:** Core user interactions, such as browsing campaigns, submitting content, and dashboard loading, should be responsive. Video upload/processing times should be managed effectively, possibly through background tasks.

#### 2.1.5. Maintainability & Evolvability
> **Goal:** The codebase should be understandable, well-organized, and testable to allow for efficient maintenance and the addition of new features post-MVP. A modular approach is preferred.

#### 2.1.6. Usability (from a developer/operational perspective)
> **Goal:** The system should be reasonably easy to develop for, deploy, and operate, especially given a potentially small initial team. Leveraging managed cloud services can support this goal.

### 2.2. Significant Constraints

The following constraints have influenced the architectural decisions for the MVP:

#### 2.2.1. Time-to-market (MVP focus)
> **Constraint:** The primary goal is to launch a functional MVP quickly to validate the core business proposition. This favors simpler designs and proven technologies that the team can leverage efficiently.

#### 2.2.2. Initially small development team
> **Constraint:** The architecture should not impose excessive operational overhead or require highly specialized niche skills not readily available to a small team.

#### 2.2.3. Budget considerations for services
> **Constraint:** Cost-effectiveness is important. Choices will lean towards services with generous free tiers for MVP scale or pay-as-you-go models that align with usage.

#### 2.2.4. Reliance on external platform APIs (for view tracking in the long run)
> **Constraint:** While the MVP will simplify view tracking, the long-term success depends on integrating with social media platform APIs, which can be unreliable or change. The architecture should be flexible enough to adapt to this.

### 3.2. Component Descriptions

*   **Users (Brand/Clipper):** Human users interacting with the system via the mobile application.
*   **Mobile Application:** The primary interface for users, built using a cross-platform framework (React Native or Flutter). It handles UI, local state, and communication with the backend.
*   **API Gateway / Load Balancer:** (Cloud service, e.g., AWS API Gateway/ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancing) Manages incoming API requests, distributes traffic to backend services, and can handle SSL termination, authentication.
*   **Core Backend Service(s):** The main application logic resides here. For MVP, this will likely be a monolith built with Node.js or Python. It handles business logic for users, campaigns, submissions, view processing (simplified for MVP), and orchestrates payments with Stripe.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** The primary persistent store for structured data like user profiles, campaign details, submissions, view counts, and payout records.
*   **Object Storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage):** Used for storing unstructured data, primarily video files (raw footage uploaded by brands, edited clips submitted by clippers).
*   **Payment Gateway (Stripe Connect):** An external service integrated to handle payment processing, including payouts to clippers and commission handling for ContentFlow.

## 4. Component Deep Dive

This section provides more detailed information on each major component of the ContentFlow MVP architecture.

### 4.1. Mobile Application

#### 4.1.1. Chosen Technology
The ContentFlow application is a **Next.js web application**. To provide a mobile-first, app-like experience, it will be enhanced as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**. This approach leverages the existing web codebase to deliver an accessible and performant experience on mobile devices.

#### 4.1.2. Key Modules/Features
The mobile app will contain modules corresponding to the MVP features:
*   **User Authentication:** Signup, Login, Profile Management screens.
*   **Brand Campaign Management:** Campaign creation, listing active/past campaigns, viewing submissions.
*   **Clipper Workflow:** Campaign browsing, application, content submission, earnings dashboard.
*   **Shared:** In-app messaging (basic), dashboards.

#### 4.1.3. State Management Approach
For the Next.js/React application, state management will leverage **React Context API** for simpler global state needs. For more complex client-side state, options like **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** could be considered if the complexity warrants it. The goal is a predictable state flow, easy debugging, and maintainability within the React ecosystem.

#### 4.1.4. API Interaction
*   The PWA will communicate with the Backend API via HTTPS using RESTful principles.
*   Requests and responses will primarily use JSON.
*   An abstraction layer (e.g., a service module using `fetch` or `axios`) will handle API calls to keep UI components clean.
*   Authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) will be managed securely (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies or secure local storage mechanisms) and sent with relevant requests.

#### 4.1.5. Local Storage/Caching Strategy (MVP)
For the PWA, local storage and caching are critical for performance and offline capabilities:
*   **User Session:** Securely store authentication tokens (e.g., JWT) in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` (considering security implications of `localStorage`).
*   **Service Worker Caching:** Implement a service worker to cache static assets (JS, CSS, images), the application shell, and potentially key API responses for offline access or faster load times.
*   **Browser Cache:** Leverage standard browser caching mechanisms for other assets.
Heavy or complex offline data storage beyond basic caching of UI shell and static assets is not an MVP priority but can be expanded via IndexedDB if needed post-MVP.

#### 4.1.6. PWA Strategy for ContentFlow

**Reasoning for Choosing a PWA Approach:**

Given ContentFlow's existing foundation as a Next.js web application and the desire for a "mobile-first" experience that can be achieved rapidly, adopting a Progressive Web App (PWA) strategy is an excellent approach. This allows us to leverage the current web codebase to deliver an enhanced, app-like experience on mobile devices without the overhead of developing and maintaining a separate native mobile application (e.g., via React Native/Expo) for the MVP. The goal is to make the web application highly accessible and performant on mobile, offering features typically associated with native apps.

**Benefits for ContentFlow (Next.js App):**

*   **Installable:** Users can add ContentFlow to their mobile device's home screen, allowing it to be launched like a native app, providing easy access.
*   **App-like Experience:** PWAs can run in their own full-screen window, without the standard browser UI, offering a more immersive user experience.
*   **Enhanced Performance & Offline Capabilities:** Through service workers, parts of the application (like static assets, core UI shells, and even previously viewed data) can be cached. This enables faster load times, smoother performance, and basic offline access (e.g., viewing cached content or an offline fallback page if the network is unavailable).
*   **Reach & Discoverability:** PWAs are still web applications, so they are discoverable via search engines and shareable via URLs.
*   **No App Store Submission (for core PWA functionality):** Core PWA features don't require submission to app stores, allowing for quicker deployment cycles for web-based updates.
*   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Provides a consistent experience across different mobile operating systems (iOS, Android) as it's based on web technologies.
*   **Leverages Existing Stack:** Builds directly upon the Next.js/React/Tailwind CSS foundation, making development more streamlined.

**Key Technical Components for a ContentFlow PWA:**

1.  **Web App Manifest (`manifest.json`):**
    *   A JSON file that provides metadata about the PWA, such as its name (`ContentFlow`), icons (for the home screen), start URL, display mode (e.g., `standalone` for an app-like feel), theme colors, etc.
    *   Next.js typically offers straightforward ways to configure or generate this manifest.

2.  **Service Worker (`sw.js`):**
    *   A JavaScript file that runs in the background, separate from the web page, and acts as a programmable network proxy.
    *   **For MVP PWA:** Its primary role will be to implement caching strategies (e.g., caching static assets, API responses for offline viewing if appropriate, application shell) to improve performance and provide basic offline support.
    *   **Future Capabilities:** Service workers can also handle background sync, push notifications.
    *   Next.js often integrates with libraries like Workbox to simplify service worker generation and management.

3.  **HTTPS:**
    *   A fundamental requirement for PWAs. The ContentFlow application must be served over HTTPS to enable service workers and ensure security. This is standard practice for modern web applications.

4.  **Responsive Design:**
    *   The UI must be fully responsive and adapt well to various mobile screen sizes and orientations. The existing use of Tailwind CSS is well-suited for this.

By implementing these PWA features, ContentFlow can significantly enhance its mobile web presence, offering users a more engaging and reliable experience that bridges the gap between a traditional website and a native mobile application, all while working within the existing Next.js framework.

### 4.2. Backend System

#### 4.2.1. Chosen Technology
As per the Project Documentation, the backend will be developed using **Node.js (with a framework like Express.js or NestJS) or Python (with a framework like FastAPI or Flask)**. The choice will be driven by team expertise and the ecosystem for required integrations (like payment gateways).

#### 4.2.2. Monolith vs. Microservices
*   > **Recommendation for MVP:** A **Monolithic architecture** is recommended for the initial MVP.
*   **Rationale:**
    *   Simpler to develop, test, and deploy for a small team and tight schedule.
    *   Reduced operational complexity compared to managing multiple microservices.
    *   Avoids premature optimization.
*   > **Future Consideration:** Design the monolith with clear logical modules (e.g., by domain: users, campaigns, payments) to facilitate easier refactoring into microservices post-MVP as the system scales and new, specialized functionalities are added.

#### 4.2.3. Core API Service(s) - Responsibilities
The monolithic backend service will handle:
*   **User Authentication & Authorization:** User registration, login, session management, role-based access control (basic for MVP).
*   **Campaign Management:** CRUD operations for campaigns, linking brands to campaigns.
*   **Content Submission & Management:** Handling uploads (metadata, links to Object Storage), associating submissions with campaigns and clippers.
*   **Dashboard Data Aggregation:** Compiling data for brand and clipper dashboards.
*   **View Count Processing (Initial manual/link-based):** Endpoints for admins or a trusted process to update view counts for submissions.
*   **Payment Logic Orchestration:** Calculating amounts due, triggering payout processes via Stripe Connect, handling commission logic.

#### 4.2.4. Key API Endpoint Groups (RESTful)
APIs will be designed following RESTful principles. Examples:
*   `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`
*   `/users/me`, `/users/{userId}/profile`
*   `/campaigns`, `/campaigns/{campaignId}`
*   `/campaigns/{campaignId}/submissions`
*   `/submissions/{submissionId}`
*   `/submissions/{submissionId}/views` (for admin updates initially)
*   `/payments/payouts` (internal/admin)

### 4.3. Database

#### 4.3.1. Chosen Technology
**PostgreSQL** is the recommended relational database, as stated in the Project Documentation.

#### 4.3.2. Conceptual Schema Overview
Key tables will include (but are not limited to):
*   **Users:** `user_id` (PK), `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (brand/clipper), `created_at`.
*   **BrandProfiles:** `user_id` (FK to Users), `company_name`, (Stripe customer ID - future).
*   **ClipperProfiles:** `user_id` (FK to Users), `social_links` (JSONB or separate table), `payout_info_placeholder` (Stripe account ID - future).
*   **Campaigns:** `campaign_id` (PK), `brand_user_id` (FK to Users), `title`, `brief`, `raw_content_url`, `budget_structure`, `target_platforms`, `status`, `created_at`.
*   **Submissions:** `submission_id` (PK), `campaign_id` (FK to Campaigns), `clipper_user_id` (FK to Users), `edited_content_url`, `platform_links` (JSONB), `status` (pending, approved), `submitted_at`.
*   **Views:** `view_id` (PK), `submission_id` (FK to Submissions), `view_count`, `tracked_at`, `verification_status` (e.g., 'pending_verification', 'verified', 'disputed').
*   **Payouts:** `payout_id` (PK), `submission_id` (FK to Submissions), `clipper_user_id` (FK to Users), `amount`, `commission_amount`, `status` (pending, paid), `transaction_date`.
Relationships will be enforced using foreign keys. Indexes will be created on frequently queried columns.

#### 4.3.3. Data Integrity Considerations
*   Use of foreign key constraints to maintain relational integrity.
*   Transactions for operations spanning multiple tables (e.g., creating a campaign and linking it to a brand).
*   Validation at the API layer before data insertion/updates.

### 4.4. Object Storage

#### 4.4.1. Purpose
To store large binary files, primarily video content:
*   Raw footage and assets uploaded by Brands for campaigns.
*   Edited video clips submitted by Clippers.

#### 4.4.2. Chosen Service
A managed object storage service like **AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage**. The choice may depend on the primary cloud provider selected.

#### 4.4.3. Access Control & Security
*   Private buckets by default.
*   Signed URLs or temporary credentials for secure uploading and controlled access to content by authorized users (e.g., a brand viewing a submission, a clipper uploading a file).
*   Consider versioning for raw assets if brands might update them.

### 4.5. View Tracking (MVP Approach)

> **MVP Focus:** For MVP, view tracking will be a simplified process...
#### 4.5.1. Initial Implementation
For MVP, view tracking will be a simplified process integrated within the **Core Backend Service**, not a separate, complex AI service.

#### 4.5.2. Process
1.  **Clipper Submission:** Clipper submits the direct link(s) to their live content on social media platforms.
2.  **Admin/System Verification Queue:** Links are added to a queue for verification.
    *   Basic automated checks: Link validity (responds with 200 OK).
    *   Manual check: An admin reviews the link and the content to ensure it matches the campaign. They may also manually check the view count displayed on the platform.
3.  **View Count Update:** Admin updates the view count in the system for that submission. This could be via an internal admin UI.
4.  **Dispute/Flagging:** Brands might be given an option to flag submissions if they suspect inaccurate view counts, triggering a re-review.

#### 4.5.3. Future Considerations
*   Development of a dedicated microservice for view tracking.
*   Integration with official social media APIs where available and permitted (often very restrictive for this use case).
*   Development of more robust, ethical scraping techniques if APIs are insufficient (high risk, platform ToS concerns).
*   Basic AI/heuristics to flag suspicious view patterns.

### 4.6. Payment Gateway Integration

#### 4.6.1. Chosen Service
**Stripe Connect** is recommended, as it's designed for marketplaces needing to facilitate payments between buyers (Brands) and sellers (Clippers) while handling platform commissions.

#### 4.6.2. Key Flows (Conceptual for MVP, manual elements initially)
1.  **Brand Onboarding (Future):** Brands would connect their payment methods to Stripe (e.g., credit card). For MVP, this might be simulated or handled outside the app.
2.  **Clipper Onboarding:** Clippers would set up Stripe Express accounts (or similar) via an onboarding flow integrated with Stripe Connect, allowing them to receive payouts.
3.  **Campaign Funding (Future):** Brands might pre-fund campaigns or have payment methods charged upon successful content delivery. MVP might skip direct campaign funding through Stripe.
4.  **Payout Calculation:** The Core Backend Service calculates the amount due to the clipper based on verified views and campaign terms, minus the platform's commission.
5.  **Payout Execution:** Using Stripe Connect APIs, the platform initiates transfers from its account (or the brand's, depending on the Stripe Connect model chosen) to the clipper's connected Stripe account. For MVP, this step might be manually triggered by an admin based on system calculations.

#### 4.6.3. Secure Handling of Payment-Related Information
*   The application itself will **not** store sensitive payment details like full credit card numbers.
*   It will rely on Stripe's secure environment and APIs (e.g., Stripe Elements for frontend, tokenization) for handling payment information.
*   Securely manage Stripe API keys and webhooks.

## 5. Data Flow Diagrams (Conceptual)

This section describes the data flow for key user stories. These are textual descriptions; formal diagrams (e.g., using UML or BPMN) would be developed in a detailed design phase.

### 5.1. User Registration and Profile Setup

2.  **Backend API:** Calculates final payout amounts, including platform commission.
3.  **Admin Interface/Tool:** Admin reviews pending payouts.
4.  **Admin:** Manually processes payouts outside the system (e.g., via bank transfer, PayPal).
5.  **Admin Interface/Tool -> Backend API:** Admin marks payout as "Paid" (`POST /payments/payouts/{payoutId}/mark-paid`).
6.  **Backend API -> Database:** Updates `Payouts` record status.
7.  **Mobile App (Clipper - on request):** Earnings dashboard reflects updated payout status.

## 6. Deployment View (Conceptual MVP)

### 6.1. Cloud Provider
As per the Project Documentation, a major cloud provider like **AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure** will be used, chosen based on team familiarity and service offerings.

### 6.2. Mobile App Deployment
*   **iOS:** Via Apple App Store Connect.
*   **Android:** Via Google Play Console.
*   Builds will be managed through CI/CD pipelines.

### 6.3. Backend Deployment

#### 6.3.1. Containerization
*   The backend application (monolith for MVP) will be packaged as a **Docker container**. This ensures consistency across environments.

#### 6.3.2. Hosting Environment (Managed Service Preferred)
*   > **Recommendation:** A managed container orchestration service or "serverless containers" platform.
    *   **AWS:** Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate, or Elastic Beanstalk with Docker. AWS App Runner.
    *   **GCP:** Google Cloud Run, or Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) - GKE might be overkill for MVP.
    *   **Azure:** Azure Container Instances (ACI), Azure App Service for Containers.
*   **Rationale:** Reduces operational overhead for the MVP team. Allows for auto-scaling (basic configuration).

#### 6.3.3. Basic Load Balancing
*   An Application Load Balancer (ALB/ELB on AWS, Google Cloud Load Balancing, Azure Application Gateway) will be placed in front of the backend service instances to distribute traffic and handle SSL termination.

### 6.4. Database Deployment
*   > **Recommendation:** A managed relational database service.
    *   **AWS:** RDS for PostgreSQL.
    *   **GCP:** Google Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.
    *   **Azure:** Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
*   **Rationale:** Handles backups, patching, scaling (to some extent), and availability, reducing operational burden.

### 6.5. CI/CD Pipeline (Conceptual)
A basic CI/CD pipeline will be established:
1.  **Source Control:** Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):**
    *   On push to main/develop branch: Automatically build mobile app & backend container.
    *   Run automated tests (unit, basic integration).
3.  **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
    *   **Staging (Optional for early MVP but recommended):** Deploy to a staging environment for further testing.
    *   **Production:** Manual trigger or automated deployment (on tag/release branch) to the production environment.
    *   Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, or cloud-specific tools (AWS CodePipeline, Google Cloud Build, Azure DevOps).

## 7. Security Considerations

Security is a primary concern and will be addressed at multiple layers.

### 7.1. Authentication & Authorization
*   **Authentication:**
    *   JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be issued upon successful login.
    *   Tokens will be short-lived and include user ID and role.
    *   Secure storage of tokens on the mobile client.
    *   Password hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for stored passwords.
*   **Authorization:**
    *   Backend API endpoints will enforce role-based access control (RBAC) based on the user's role (Brand, Clipper, Admin) extracted from the JWT.
    *   Users can only access/modify their own resources unless explicitly permitted by their role.

### 7.2. Data Protection
*   > **Best Practice:** **Encryption in Transit:** All communication between the mobile app and backend API, and between backend services and external services (like Stripe), will use HTTPS/TLS.
*   > **Best Practice:** **Encryption at Rest:**
    *   Database: Leverage managed database service options for encryption at rest.
    *   Object Storage: Enable server-side encryption for stored media files.
*   **Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive information unnecessarily. Anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible for analytics.

### 7.3. Input Validation
*   > **Critical:** All incoming data to the Backend API (from mobile app or internal tools) will be rigorously validated on the server-side to prevent common injection attacks (SQLi, XSS - though XSS is less of a direct threat to a JSON API, sanitation is good practice if data is ever rendered elsewhere).
*   Use parameterized queries/ORMs for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.

### 7.4. API Security
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to protect against DoS attacks and abuse.
*   **Secure Headers:** Use security-related HTTP headers (e.g., HSTS, CSP - though CSP is more for web apps, good to be aware of).
*   **Error Handling:** Generic error messages to avoid leaking internal system details.

### 7.5. Secure Handling of Media Uploads
*   Scan uploaded files for malware if possible (can be a complex/costly feature).
*   Use pre-signed URLs for direct uploads to Object Storage to limit backend server load and exposure. Ensure these URLs are short-lived and specific to the user/upload.

### 7.6. Secrets Management
*   > **Critical:** **Secrets Management:** API keys, database credentials, JWT secrets, and other sensitive configuration will be managed securely, not hardcoded in source.
*   Use environment variables injected at runtime or a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., `AWS Secrets Manager`, `Google Secret Manager`, `HashiCorp Vault`).

## 8. Scalability & Performance Considerations

The architecture is designed with future scalability and good performance for the MVP in mind.

### 8.1. Backend Scalability
*   **Stateless API Design:** The Core Backend Service (monolith for MVP) should be designed to be stateless where possible, meaning each API request can be handled independently without relying on server-side session memory. This allows for easy horizontal scaling by adding more instances of the backend service behind a load balancer.
*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Cloud hosting platforms (AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, etc.) allow for configuring auto-scaling rules based on CPU utilization or request count to automatically adjust the number of running backend instances.

### 8.2. Database Scalability
*   **Managed Services:** Using a managed PostgreSQL service (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) allows for easier scaling of resources (CPU, RAM, Storage) as needed.
*   **Read Replicas (Future):** For read-heavy workloads, read replicas can be introduced post-MVP to offload read traffic from the primary database instance.
*   **Connection Pooling:** The backend service will use database connection pooling to efficiently manage connections to the database, improving performance and reducing resource consumption.
*   **Query Optimization:** Regularly review and optimize database queries, especially for frequently accessed data or complex joins. Use database indexes effectively.

### 8.3. Media Handling
*   **Direct Uploads/Downloads (Future):** While MVP might proxy, for better performance and scalability, large media files should ideally be uploaded directly to and served directly from Object Storage (e.g., S3, GCS) using pre-signed URLs. This offloads traffic from the backend service.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN) (Future):** For serving frequently accessed media content (e.g., popular clips, if that feature arises), a CDN (like AWS CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN) can be used to cache content closer to users, reducing latency.

### 8.4. Asynchronous Operations
*   **Background Jobs:** For tasks that can be time-consuming and don't require an immediate response, consider using a background job/task queue system (e.g., Celery with RabbitMQ/Redis, or simpler solutions for MVP like a separate thread pool if language appropriate, or serverless functions).
    *   Examples: Video processing (if any client-side optimization is insufficient), sending email notifications, generating complex reports (future).
*   **Decoupling:** This improves API responsiveness as the client doesn't have to wait for these long-running tasks to complete.

### 8.5. API Response Times
*   Optimize critical path API endpoints by ensuring efficient database queries, minimizing external service calls within a single request-response cycle, and using appropriate data structures.
*   Implement pagination for API responses that return lists of items to avoid transferring large amounts of data.

## 10. Future Architectural Evolution

The current MVP architecture is designed to be a foundation. As ContentFlow grows and requirements evolve, the architecture may undergo the following transformations:

### 10.1. Transition to Microservices
*   **Trigger:** Increased complexity in the monolith, need for independent scaling of specific functionalities, or desire for technology diversity across services.
*   **Potential Microservices:**
    *   User Management Service
    *   Campaign Service
    *   Submission Service
    *   View Tracking & Analytics Service (incorporating AI/ML)
    *   Notification Service
    *   Payment Service (wrapping Stripe interactions more abstractly)
*   **Communication:** REST APIs initially, potentially evolving to asynchronous event-driven communication (e.g., using Kafka, RabbitMQ, or cloud-native messaging services).
*   **API Gateway:** Will become even more crucial for routing requests to the appropriate microservices.

### 10.2. Dedicated AI/ML Services
*   For advanced view-bot detection, content performance prediction, or intelligent campaign matching.
*   These could be developed in Python using relevant AI/ML frameworks and libraries.

### 10.3. Event-Driven Architecture
*   For better decoupling between services, improved resilience, and enabling more complex workflows.
*   Events (e.g., `CampaignCreated`, `SubmissionReceived`, `ViewsVerified`, `PayoutProcessed`) would be published to a message bus/event stream.

### 10.4. Advanced Analytics Pipeline
*   Implementing a data pipeline (e.g., using AWS Kinesis/Glue or GCP Dataflow/BigQuery) to collect, process, and analyze application data for business intelligence, trend analysis, and improving AI models.

### 10.5. More Sophisticated CI/CD and Observability
*   **CI/CD:** Advanced deployment strategies (e.g., blue/green, canary releases).
*   **Observability:** Comprehensive logging, distributed tracing, and monitoring across all services using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Datadog, or cloud-specific solutions (AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring).

### 10.6. Service Mesh (with Microservices)
*   If the number of microservices grows significantly, a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) could be introduced to manage inter-service communication, security, and observability more effectively.

## 11. Addendum: Architectural Implications of Payper Model Adoption

Adopting the Payper-centric model, which emphasizes streamlined social integration and specific user flows (like OTP verification and detailed campaign status management), introduces several architectural considerations or reinforces existing ones:

*   > **Implication:** **OTP Service Integration:**
    *   The backend needs to integrate with an SMS/Email OTP service (e.g., `Twilio`, `SendGrid`, or a custom solution) to manage the sending and verification of one-time passwords during user registration. This implies secure API key management and potentially tracking OTP attempt limits.

*   > **Implication:** **Robust Social Media API Integration (especially TikTok):**
    *   **OAuth 2.0 Handling:** The backend must securely manage OAuth 2.0 flows for connecting user social media accounts (initially TikTok). This includes handling callbacks, exchanging authorization codes for access/refresh tokens, and securely storing these tokens (e.g., encrypted in the database).
    *   **Token Management & Refresh:** A system for refreshing access tokens as needed and securely managing API keys/secrets for ContentFlow's own app registration with these platforms.
    *   **API Versioning & Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of external API version changes and adhere to their rate limits. The architecture should allow for graceful degradation or queuing if limits are hit.

*   > **Implication:** **Specific Data Model Changes:**
    *   **Campaign Statuses:** The `Campaigns` table will require more granular status fields (e.g., `"Pending Approval"`, `"In Progress"`, `"Under Review"`, `"Finished"`, `"Discarded"`) to reflect the Payper-like workflow, impacting how campaigns are queried and displayed.
    *   **User Profiles:** `ClipperProfiles` may need fields for storing connected social account identifiers (e.g., TikTok user ID, username) and potentially portfolio links or aggregated stats derived from connected accounts (post-MVP).
    *   **OTP Management:** Tables might be needed to store OTPs, their expiry times, and verification status, linked to user accounts.

*   > **Implication:** **Enhanced Notification System:**
    *   The need for timely updates (e.g., campaign approval, submission status changes, new messages) increases. This may require a more robust notification system supporting:
        *   **In-app notifications:** Displayed within the mobile app.
        *   **Push notifications:** To alert users when they are not actively using the app. This involves integration with services like `Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)` for Android and `Apple Push Notification service (APNs)` for iOS.

*   > **Implication:** **Handling WebViews/Browser Interactions for Social Logins:**
    *   The mobile application architecture must seamlessly handle transitions to and from WebViews (or custom browser tabs/app switching) used for external OAuth provider logins (like TikTok). This includes securely passing context and receiving authorization responses (e.g., via deep linking or custom URL schemes).

*   > **Implication:** **Increased Importance of Admin/Moderation Tools:**
    *   With more direct social integration and user-generated content links, robust admin tools become more critical for:
        *   Verifying authenticity of connected accounts (initial phase).
        *   Reviewing flagged content or campaigns.
        *   Managing disputes related to content or views.
        *   (As before) Manually verifying view counts and processing payouts in MVP.

*   > **Implication:** **Heightened Security Considerations for Third-Party API Integrations:**
    *   Secure storage and handling of third-party API keys and user access tokens are paramount.
    *   Careful validation of data received from external APIs.
    *   Understanding and adhering to the security policies and data usage guidelines of each integrated social media platform.
    *   Ensuring user consent is clearly obtained and managed for accessing their social media data.

This addendum clarifies the architectural adjustments or areas of emphasis resulting from the shift to a more Payper-inspired operational model.
