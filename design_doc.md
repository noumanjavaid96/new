# Design Document: Code Generation Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the design for a Code Generation Agent, a software tool that assists users in generating code snippets and completing coding tasks. The agent will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrate with the user's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to provide a seamless and efficient coding experience. The primary goal is to reduce boilerplate code, accelerate development, and assist users in learning new programming languages and frameworks.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

*   **Goal:** Develop an intelligent agent that can generate high-quality code snippets based on user prompts.
    *   **Objective:** Implement core code generation functionality using LLMs.
    *   **Objective:** Ensure generated code is syntactically correct and adheres to common coding conventions.
*   **Goal:** Integrate the agent seamlessly into popular IDEs.
    *   **Objective:** Develop plugins for VS Code and JetBrains IDEs.
    *   **Objective:** Provide an intuitive user interface within the IDE for interacting with the agent.
*   **Goal:** Assist users in learning and exploration.
    *   **Objective:** Offer explanations for generated code.
    *   **Objective:** Allow users to ask clarifying questions about the code.
*   **Goal:** Ensure the agent is reliable and performs efficiently.
    *   **Objective:** Optimize LLM interactions for speed.
    *   **Objective:** Implement robust error handling and logging.

## 3. High-Level Design

The Code Generation Agent will consist of the following key components:

*   **IDE Plugin:** This component will be responsible for the user interface within the IDE. It will capture user prompts, display generated code, and handle interactions like accepting, rejecting, or modifying suggestions.
*   **Backend Service:** This service will host the LLM and handle the core logic of code generation. It will receive requests from the IDE plugin, interact with the LLM, and return the generated code.
*   **LLM Abstraction Layer:** This layer will provide a consistent interface for interacting with different LLMs, allowing for flexibility in choosing or switching LLM providers.
*   **Contextualizer:** This component will gather relevant context from the user's current project (e.g., open files, project structure, existing code) to provide more accurate and relevant code suggestions.
*   **Telemetry Service:** (Optional, for later versions) Collects anonymized usage data to help improve the agent's performance and features.

A typical workflow would be:
1. User types a prompt (e.g., "create a Python function to read a CSV file") in their IDE.
2. The IDE Plugin sends the prompt and relevant context to the Backend Service.
3. The Backend Service, via the LLM Abstraction Layer, queries the LLM.
4. The LLM generates code based on the prompt and context.
5. The Backend Service returns the code to the IDE Plugin.
6. The IDE Plugin displays the code to the user.
7. The user can accept, modify, or reject the suggestion.

## 4. User Experience (UX)

The agent's UX will prioritize ease of use and minimal disruption to the developer's workflow.

*   **Invocation:**
    *   Users can invoke the agent via a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+G` or `Cmd+Shift+G`).
    *   Context menu option ("Ask Code Gen Agent") on selected code or in a file.
    *   A dedicated input field/panel within the IDE.
*   **Input:**
    *   Natural language prompts for code generation (e.g., "create a Java class for a customer with name and email fields").
    *   Ability to select existing code and ask for modifications, explanations, or bug fixes.
*   **Output:**
    *   Generated code will be displayed directly in the editor, either inline as a suggestion (ghost text) or in a diff view.
    *   Clear indication of where the generated code comes from (e.g., a small agent icon or tooltip).
    *   Options to accept, reject, or request alternatives for the suggestion.
    *   Explanations for generated code can be shown in a separate panel or on hover.
*   **Feedback:**
    *   Visual cues for when the agent is processing a request.
    *   Clear error messages if something goes wrong (e.g., LLM connection issues, unclear prompt).
*   **Customization:**
    *   (Future) Allow users to specify coding style preferences (e.g., indentation, naming conventions).
    *   (Future) Ability to connect to different LLM backends or specify local models.

## 5. Design Phase Next Steps

To move forward with the design and into implementation, the following steps are crucial:

1.  **Detailed API Design:** Define the precise API specifications for communication between the IDE Plugin and the Backend Service. This includes request/response schemas, authentication methods, and error codes.
2.  **IDE Plugin Prototyping:** Develop basic functional prototypes for VS Code and a JetBrains IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to test core interaction patterns and gather early user feedback.
3.  **LLM Evaluation and Selection:** Conduct a thorough evaluation of candidate LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-series, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini) based on code generation quality, speed, cost, and API availability. Select an initial LLM for the first version.
4.  **Contextualizer Strategy:** Define the initial strategy for collecting and utilizing context from the user's IDE. Start with simple context (e.g., current file language, surrounding lines of code) and plan for more advanced context gathering.
5.  **Security and Privacy Review:** Analyze potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., prompt injection, insecure handling of user code) and define measures to protect user data and privacy.
6.  **Telemetry Plan (Initial Draft):** Outline what anonymized data would be useful to collect (if any, and with user consent) for future improvements, and how it would be handled.
7.  **Refine Non-Functional Requirements:** Add more specific metrics and targets to the NFRs based on initial prototyping and LLM evaluation.

## 6. Technology Stack

The proposed technology stack aims for robustness, scalability, and compatibility with common development environments.

*   **IDE Plugins:**
    *   **VS Code:** TypeScript/JavaScript (using VS Code Extension API).
    *   **JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.):** Java/Kotlin (using IntelliJ Platform SDK).
*   **Backend Service:**
    *   **Programming Language:** Python (due to its strong AI/ML ecosystem and web framework options like FastAPI or Flask).
    *   **LLM Abstraction Layer:** Python library to interface with chosen LLM(s).

*   **Security:**
    *   All communication between the IDE plugin and backend must be over HTTPS.
    *   User code and prompts should be handled securely, with clear policies on data retention and privacy.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) for the backend service.
*   **Usability:**
    *   Users should be able to perform common tasks (generate code, get explanations) with minimal clicks/keystrokes.
    *   Documentation (user guides, API docs) should be clear and comprehensive.
*   **Maintainability:**
    *   Codebase should be well-documented, with unit tests and integration tests.
    *   Modular design to allow for independent updates to components.
*   **Extensibility:**

## 9. Key Challenges & Risks for MVP

*   **LLM Performance & Cost:**
    *   **Challenge:** Ensuring low latency for code suggestions while managing the operational costs of LLM API calls.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize prompts, explore caching strategies for common requests, evaluate different LLM models for cost/performance trade-offs.
*   **Quality of Generated Code:**
    *   **Challenge:** LLMs can sometimes produce incorrect, inefficient, or insecure code.
    *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous testing, clear communication to users about the agent's limitations, prompt engineering, potentially incorporating static analysis tools for generated snippets.
*   **Contextual Understanding:**
    *   **Challenge:** Providing genuinely helpful suggestions requires understanding the user's current coding context, which can be complex.
    *   **Mitigation (MVP):** Start with simple context (current file, language, selected code). Iterate and enhance context gathering post-MVP.
*   **IDE Integration Complexity:**
    *   **Challenge:** Different IDEs have vastly different extension models and capabilities.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on one IDE (VS Code) for MVP to manage complexity. Leverage learnings for subsequent IDE integrations.
*   **User Acceptance and Trust:**
    *   **Challenge:** Developers may be hesitant to trust or use AI-generated code.
    *   **Mitigation:** Ensure transparency (clearly mark generated code), provide options to accept/reject/modify, prioritize accuracy and reliability.
*   **Security of User Code:**
    *   **Challenge:** User code sent to a backend service (even if for LLM processing) raises security concerns.
    *   **Mitigation:** Clear data handling policies, HTTPS for all communication, explore options for local/on-device LLMs for future versions if privacy concerns are paramount.

## 10. Monetization Strategy (Preliminary)

This section outlines potential monetization strategies, assuming the agent gains traction.

*   **Freemium Model:**
    *   **Free Tier:** Basic code generation capabilities, limited number of requests per day/month, support for common languages.
    *   **Premium Tier (Subscription):** Unlimited requests, access to more advanced/powerful LLMs, support for more languages, advanced features like whole-project context analysis, priority support.
*   **Usage-Based Billing:**
    *   For power users or enterprise clients, potentially offer billing based on the number of API calls or compute resources consumed.
*   **Enterprise Licensing:**
    *   Offer self-hosted versions or dedicated instances for large organizations with specific security and compliance needs.
*   **Marketplace for Specialized Agents:**
    *   (Long-term vision) Allow third parties to develop and sell specialized code generation agents (e.g., for specific frameworks or internal company libraries) on our platform.

The initial MVP will likely be free to maximize adoption and gather feedback. Monetization will be explored post-MVP based on user uptake and feature development.
